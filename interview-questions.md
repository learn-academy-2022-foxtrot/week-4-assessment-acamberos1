# ASSESSMENT 4: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is object-oriented programming? How is it different than functional programming?

Your answer: object oriented programming is a structure of programming based on pre programmed objects already set with certain data and behaviors. functional is another type of programming architecure where it uses a more flexible approach but also more precise coding to enable developers to have more control over the code and make the data and behavior themselves rather than rely on pre coded objects

Researched answer: object oriented programming focuses on objects that are instances of classes while functional programming focus more on using function and variables for their data and behavior. OOP uses loops for iteration while functional uses recursion.

2. What is the difference between a Float and an Integer in Ruby?

Your answer: float is a fraction or decimal number while integer is a whole number. Integer don't really need special declaration but you need to declare if a value is a float value to make the function work properly

Researched answer: integers can range from whole numbers that are negative, 0 and positive numbers. float is the same with positive and negative but is imprecise and are usually shown as a decimal.

3. Ruby has an implicit return. What does that mean?

Your answer: implicit return in ruby means to  return the last line of any method written unless the developer makes changes in the code to prevent that. If they dont make changes then it will process the way it was originally made to.


Researched answer: implicit return outputs the last line of every method in the code unless otherwise written. This is true no matter how many methods are written.

4. What is a block in Ruby?

Your answer: blocks from my memory at the top of my head means an anon function. Anon functions are functions not given a name.

Researched answer:blocks are reusable chunks of code that are anon and are not given their own title. They can be invoked throughout the code multiple times. to call a block within a value a yield statement must be used.

1. How do you extract a value in a Ruby hash?

Your answer: to call a value in ruby hash you can either use the key or have a method pass in the key and value parameter and call the value then

Researched answer: values can be accessed individually or in groups by invoking the keys attached to them. if the developer declares a value named sugar with the key granular simply printing out granular will access the value

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

1. PostgreSQL: ruby

2. Ruby on Rails: is a full stack framework, It bundles with all the tools needed to make web apps on both the front and back end side of coding.

3. ORM: Object-relational mapping (ORM) is a programming procedure in which a metadata descriptor is used to connect object code to a relational database.

4. Active Record: is the is the layer of the system responsible for representing business data and logic. it is used for data storage

5. Migrations: transportation of code from one system to another system.
